# mpl_project
The purpose of the project is to recreate the site of Eudoxus.gr (distribution of books for greek universities). 
The main objective was to make it more heuristic and user friendly.
This version of the project is in a very primal stage and many parts are missing. Please consider it as a small part of the actual project.
Note that no bootstrap template was used and site was build from scratch.
